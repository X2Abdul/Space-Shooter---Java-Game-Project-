      <p> 
I have experiance in both Java and Python. I did Python in college to create calculator. 
However, only for 2 months which is small time therefore I only understand basics. 
I self taught java fundamentals in summer before university and then Bootcamp at the 
start of university which helped a lot when developing Space Shooter.

    <h3>Space Shooters</h3>
    <p>
	This Java game feature a space shooter which consist of menu and multiple level. It has collectables to 
	ammo and lives which helps the player complete the game. I used absolute positioning to create menu which contains 
	start, restart and quit button. The player has abilities to used multiple weapons. Each level is unique to eachother
	which make the gaem interesting and keeps the user attention.
